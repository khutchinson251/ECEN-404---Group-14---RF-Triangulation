# ECEN-404-Group-14-RF-Triangulation
ECEN 404 GitHub Repository 

This is for the Texas A&M University Senior Design Class, ECEN 404.
Group 14, RF Triangulation

Our project is based on radio frequency triangulation, where there are three receiving antennas finding one transmitting antenna.
Transmitter have a PCB with a MCU and Radio Module.
Receivers have a PCB with a MCU, Radio Module, and Stepper Motor IC; Stepper Motor; and a 12V battery.

This GitHub will compile all presentations, code, parts, Altium designs, and documentation for the project.
